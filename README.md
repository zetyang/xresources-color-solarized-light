xresources-color-solarized-light
================================

Solarized for xresources (light theme)

The [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) colorscheme already has a xresource version, but there's only the [dark theme](https://github.com/altercation/solarized/tree/master/xresources-colors-solarized).

This version is for those who prefer the light version.

Usage:

    copy the Xresources to ~/.Xresources
    xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources
